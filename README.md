# LSTM-Based Stock Price Prediction and Trading System

**Self Project** | *Jan ’25 – May ’25*

## Overview
Developed an advanced **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** based system for stock price forecasting and trading strategy evaluation. The system integrates **data preprocessing**, **visualization**, and **algorithmic trading simulation** to provide actionable insights for market decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Flexible LSTM Model**  
  Built in Python (**PyTorch**) with adaptable dataloaders to process **high-frequency financial data**, improving forecasting accuracy.
  
- **Data Reliability & Visualization**  
  Designed preprocessing, normalization, and visualization workflows including:
  - Candlestick charts  
  - Volume trend analysis  
  - Anomaly detection for S&P 500 tickers
  
- **Algorithmic Trading Simulation**  
  Created a trading evaluation module incorporating:
  - Bid–ask spread  
  - Commission costs  
  - Profitability comparison against buy-and-hold benchmarks

## Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python, PyTorch  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, scikit-learn  
- **Data:** High-frequency S&P 500 market data

## Outcomes
- Improved prediction accuracy over baseline statistical models.
- Enabled realistic trading performance assessment through simulation with transaction cost modeling.
